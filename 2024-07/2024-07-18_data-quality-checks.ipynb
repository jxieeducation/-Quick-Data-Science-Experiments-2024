    "### Data Quality (DQ) Checks in Pipeline\n",
    "Three main points for DQ checks: Output, Input, and Mid-pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output DQ Checks\n",
    "* Ensure consumers receive correct data.\n",
    "* Table constraint checks: Null values, uniqueness, completeness, permissible ranges.\n",
    "* Business rules: Business-specific data expectations.\n",
    "* Table schema checks: Consistency of column names and types.\n",
    "* Metric variance checks: Key metrics remain within historical ranges.\n",
    "* Row count distribution checks: Consistency in row numbers across runs.\n",
    "* Reconciliation checks: Row count consistency between input and output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input DQ Checks\n",
    "* Catch issues from unreliable data sources early.\n",
    "* Table constraint checks: Similar to output checks.\n",
    "* Table schema checks: Verify expected data types and columns.\n",
    "* Referential integrity checks: Ensure joins work as expected.\n",
    "* Row count distribution checks: Consistency in input row numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mid-pipeline DQ Checks\n",
    "Useful for complex pipelines with multiple transformation layers.\n",
    "Identify issues quickly and re-run specific transformation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audit Logs\n",
    "Track incoming and outgoing row counts for each task. Aid in root-cause analysis and identifying count-distorting issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Data Monitoring Job\n",
    "Separate jobs monitoring the state of data, running at regular intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Freshness\n",
    "Ensuring data is as recent as required.\n",
    "Calculated as current time minus max(datetime_inserted).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics to Monitor\n",
    "Same types of checks as output DQ checks.\n",
    "Monitor specific fields without stopping the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Tools\n",
    "Great Expectations: Detailed results, multiple backends, but complex setup.\n",
    "dbt tests, dbt expectations, & elementary: Easy setup, expensive to run, less detailed.\n",
    "Cuallee: Easy setup, fast, detailed results, but no result logging."
